# Decoding method from Meyers et al., also used by Stokes et al. 2013.
# Basically, try to decode a certain task feature at time point Ttest based on
# a classifer trained with data from time point Ttrain.
#
# Before running this, you must run subtest.sh first to generate the data.
#
# For a certain number of 'splits', divide the whole (randomly permuted) dataset into a training
# set and a test set. Use the training set to compute the average activity of
# each neuron at each time point over all trials sharing a certain feature
# (same 1st stimulus, same 2nd stimulus, same final response). Then take every
# test trial and compute the correlations between population vector at each
# time point Ttest of the test trial and population vector at each time point Ttrain in each of the
# averages. At any pair of time points Ttrain, Ttest, the decoded feature value is the one
# for which the average population at time Ttrain has highest correlation with the test trial population
# vector at time Ttest.
#
# The final accuracy at any pair of time points Ttrain, Ttest is the percentage
# correct over all splits for this pair of time points.
